NumToolKit - Numerical Simulation ToolKit

NumTooKit is an undergoing numerical simulation toolbox covering FEA/SPH/CFD analysis.

*FEA package targets at performing nonlinear structure analysis of higly flexible material.
High Performance Parallel Computing tech with timer-triggered domain decompostion will be
implemented to conduct challenging simulation that involves mass destruction in the system,
and others such as additive manufacturing simulaiton.

*SPH package simulates Fluid, Solid and Fluid-Structural Interation problems within the
Smoothed-Particel-Hydrodynamics technique, this package is developed based on LAMMPS SPH package.
Our package functions in solid/fluid/FSI simulation, which LAMMPS's SPH does not well support.

*CFD package will be coming ... (the package partially share with FEA)
